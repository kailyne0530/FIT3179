                <p>
                    In recent centuries, a remarkable population transformation has taken place. 
                    <b>Today, our population exceeds three times 
                    larger than they were in the mid-twentieth century, with nearly 8 billions of us</b>. 
                    The latest projection by the United Nations suggests that the global population 
                    will continue to grow, expected to reach approximately 10.3 billions by 2100 and 
                    possibly peaking at over 10.4 billions in the mid-2080s â€” an unprecedented 
                    demographic shift before the end of the century.

                    Over the past five years, an intriguing pattern emerges when 
                    birth and death rates are examined across continents. <b style="color: #478778;">Asia</b> consistently maintains 
                    relatively lower birth and death rates compared to other continents. In stark 
                    contrast, <b style="color: #6F8FAF;">Africa</b> stands out with significantly higher birth and death rates. 
                    <b style="color: #FA8072;">Europe</b>, on the other hand, registers relatively elevated death rates compared 
                    to its global counterparts. <b style="color: #BF40BF;">Oceania</b>, <b style="color: #FFC000;">South America</b> and <b style="color: #E37383;">North America</b> tend to exhibit moderate 
                    birth and death rates.

                <p class="description description-left">
                    While some countries have witnessed a noteworthy increase in birth rates in the last five years, these 
                    increments pale in comparison to the substantial declines observed in other 
                    nations. For instance, <b>Hong Kong</b> has experienced a notable 37% decrease in its 
                    birth rate, while <b>China</b> follows closely with a 31% decline. These significant 
                    reductions in birth rates have transformative implications for demographic 
                    structures and social dynamics.

                <p class="description description-left">
                    Globally, the minimum decrease in death rates hovers just below 8%. However, 
                    certain countries have encountered a stark and unsettling increase in death rates. 
                    <b>Ukraine</b>, for instance, has seen a dramatic 63% spike in its death rate, while 
                    <b>Lebanon</b> faces an alarming 88% surge. These sudden increases in death rates are 
                    likely attributed to the complex interplay of factors, including political 
                    instability and conflicts, casting a somber shadow on the population's well-being.

                    While international migration is a relatively small contributor to overall 
                    population change when compared to births or deaths, its significance cannot be

                    Life expectancy has increased considerably in recent decades and this trend is 
                    set to continue. 
                    In 1950, life expectancy varied widely among nations, with countries like the 
                    <b>United States</b> and <b>Australia</b> leading, while nations such as <b>China</b> and <b>India</b> lagged with 
                    shorter average lifespans. However, by 2022, remarkable improvements were 
                    evident across the board, attributed to medical breakthroughs, economic growth,
